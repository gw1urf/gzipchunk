class GzipChunk:
    """
    This class allows you to construct a gzipped object in stages.
    Once created, you can use the "add" mehod to add strings or 
    byte arrays to the object. The "output" method will return a
    byte array containing the gzipped content.

    So far, that's nothing special. But the "add" method can also
    take a GzipChunk object, so long as that object itself hasn't
    had a GzipChunk object added to *it*. When "add" is called
    with such an object, the compressed data from the added object
    is added to the current object and, on calling the "output" method,
    you'll still end up with a valid gzip data stream.

    So what's the use of this?

    Imagine you have a large chunk of static data which you want to 
    add, inline, to many dynamically generated files, with the 
    intention of the result being a compressed stream. If you add
    the data to each plaintext and then compress, you'll end up 
    compressing the data static data many times over. If, instead,
    you compress the static data using a GzipChunk object, then 
    add *that* to the other objects as you compress them, then you'll
    only have compressed the static data once.

    Still confused?

    OK, I'll fess up. The general idea for this is to generate a vast
    collection of compressed web pages for abusive web crawlers to chew
    on. I'd like, sometimes, to plonk a zip bomb into generated pages: 
    a chunk of HTML that decompresses to several MBytes of data. But 
    generating it from raw text, on the fly, eats more of my CPU than 
    the crawler will need to decompress. 

    If I can pre-compress a large chunk of data once and insert that into
    thousands of dynamically generated compressed streams, my CPU usage 
    drops to zero, while the crawlers still need to expend effort to 
    decompress the data.

    For example:

       # On startup.
       bomb = GzipObject()
       bomb.add("++?????++ Out of Cheese Error. Redo From Start.<br/>", reps=1000000)

       ...

       # For every request...
       generated_page = GzipObject()
       generated_page.add(some_content)
       generated_page.add(bomb)
       generated_page.add(some_more_content)
       send_to_client(generated_page.output())

    Some of this code takes inspiration from Python's gzip module.
